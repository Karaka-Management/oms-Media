# Collection

A collection is a special `Media` element similar to directories. A collection can contain other collections, media elements and hard drive files & directories.

If a directory on the hard drive has the same path as the virtual path of the colllection, all files in that directory are also shown as part of that collection. If the content of the hard drive directory changes the colllection also shows the changed content.

A collection doesn't need to have a hard drive directory, this is optional.
